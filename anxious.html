            The most ironic thing about this book is that it got me into and out of the reading slump. 
            I think my brain has rewired to not be patient enough for this. It’s such a good comfort read.
            It’s dramatic, emotional, thriller and hands down to the writer for such perfect comedic timing. 
            It’s like the writer is reading your mind. He mentions the exact thing that comes to your mind at 
            somepoint that shows that he really knows his readers. This is about a hostage situation that connects 
            everyone in the best way possible. An old lady who visits her own apartment that is up for sale, a stockholmer
            homo-relationship that assures you you’ll find someone in the right way possible. A wife trying to make up forher
            husband’s lost career because she feels guilty of her accomplishments. I think it’s the nonsense comments fed to
            her as a feedback that she blames herself for her husband’s inability to get a promotion while she feels obligated
            to degrade her own accomplishments. And most importantly, why the robber actually did it. And why you assumed it 
            was a man. How empty we feel inside and nothing can really fill that void unless you actually try to mend your feelings
            yourself. No one is going to save you but you. And that’ what anxiety does to you. It doesn’t let you do that. 
            It wants you to stay miserable and scared and never succeed. You will always have someone and that will always be you.
            Everything happens for a reason and the good deed will always come back to you,
